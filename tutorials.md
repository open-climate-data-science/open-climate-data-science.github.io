## Week 1: March 2, 2022 Beginner Tutorial

The overall goal of the *beginner tutorial* is to introduce topics of open data, reproducible science, and do basic data analysis and visualization with publicly available datasets, such as those found on the State Climate Office of North Carolina's [Cardinal data portal](https://products.climate.ncsu.edu/cardinal/).

### Tutorial Goals

By the end of the Beginner Tutorial, participants will be able to:

1. **define** open data and reproducible science

2. **describe** how to navigate aspects of an R coding notebook

3. **recall** how to extract public data from a web portal (Cardinal) and import it into a data software (R)

4. **demonstrate** understanding of dataset and statistical software through exploratory data analysis plots and numerical summaries

## Week 2: March 9, 2022 Advanced Tutorial

The overall goal of the *advanced tutorial* is to introduce topics of open data, reproducible science, practice accessing publicly available climate data on the cloud, such as those found on the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) [nClimGrid data](https://nclimgrid-cisess-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), and carry out intermediate statistical analysis and modeling (e.g., time series modeling and clustering).
