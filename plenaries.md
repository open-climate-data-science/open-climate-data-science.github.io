Dr. Ryan Emanual (he/him) is an Associate Professor of Hydrology at Duke University, an environmental scientist, and a community-engaged scholar from North Carolina. He studies ecohydrology, biogeosciences, environmental justice, and Indigenous rights. Ryan leads a group of researchers who study the environment and relationships between people and the environment in North Carolina and beyond. His group also partners with Native American Tribes and other communities to understand environmental change through the lenses of environmental justice and Indigenous rights. This work involves research, education, and relationship-building. His goal is to amplify voices of Indigenous and other marginalized communities who shoulder disproportionate environmental burdens.

Dr. Chelle Gentemann (she/her) is a Senior Scientist with Farallon Institute. Chelle is a passionate advocate for open science, open source software, and inclusivity. As a physical oceanographer focused on remote sensing, she has worked for over 25 years on retrievals of ocean temperature from space and using that data to understand how the ocean impacts our lives. Her more recent research focuses on interdisciplinary science using cloud computing, open source software algorithm development, air-sea fluxes, biophysical interactions, and upper ocean physical processes. She has served on scientific committees, notably as co-chair of a standing committee for the National Academy of Sciences and has presented to a federal house committee on NASA’s implementation of scientific community priorities.
