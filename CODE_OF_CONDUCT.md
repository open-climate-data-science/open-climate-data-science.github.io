## Motivation and Values

<br>

>*We value a workshop space that is safe, judgment-free, inclusive, constructive, and supportive for **all** participants.* 

<br>

The goals of this workshop are to support a diverse range of individuals and communities across North Carolina who are impacted by climate change and seek support as they respond and adapt to these changes. We recognize that data can often be difficult for North Carolina communities to access, analyze, interpret, and put into action given their local knowledge and lived experiences. Overcoming these hurdles is what motivated us to organize this workshop. For more information about how we will overcome these hurdles, visit the workshop [About page](https://open-climate-data-science.github.io/about/). 

<br>

We developed this code of conduct to clearly state our shared values, what is expected behavior, what is unexpected behavior, how to report inappropriate and disruptive behavior, and the consequences of those behaviors for workshop participants. 

<br>

## Limits of this Code of Conduct

This code of conduct does not replace existing legal mechanisms. For incidents where a crime may have been committed, we will support the victim to report the incident, if they feel comfortable to do so.

<br>

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all workshop attendees:

- Be considerate and respectful in your speech, listening, and actions.
- Be mindful of the space you take up in conversations; we can all learn and share as workshop participants.
- Yield the floor to those with viewpoints that are under-represented.
- Be an active bystander; stay alert and engage in the welfare of those around you.
- Ask for and receive permission before sharing specific names and ideas that come up in small Zoom breakout room conversations outside of that small group.
- Give credit and acknowledgement where it is due.
- Be authentically and actively respectful of speakers and attendees who share personal stories, goals, ideas, visions, challenges, etc. By showing respect, you contribute to a positive experience for all workshop attendees.
- Use welcoming language (e.g., use a person’s stated pronouns and favor gender-neutral collective nouns such such as “you all” or “folks” rather than “guys”).
- Engage in best practices for intercultural collaborations (e.g., [Research Ethics: A Source Guide to Conducting Research with Indigenous Peoples](http://www.indigenousgeography.net/ethics.shtm), [C.A.R.E. Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://www.gida-global.org/care)).
- Alert workshop organizers immediately if you notice or experience inappropriate and disruptive behavior during the workshop.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

<br>

## Unacceptable Behavior

Behavior that is not tolerated at this workshop includes:

- Verbal and textual comments that reinforce social structures of oppression related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, age, religion, or work experience.
- Appropriation or plagiarization of knowledge shared during the workshop and in future collaborations.
Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes.
- Deliberately intimidating, stalking, following, spamming or trolling.
- Sustained disruption of talks or other aspects of this event.
Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

<br>

## Reporting & Consequences for Inappropriate & Disruptive Behavior

If someone is behaving inappropriately and disruptively during the workshop, we ask attendees to notify the workshop organizers and Zoom host immediately using the private chat function. The Zoom host will remove the disruptor from the Zoom session and activate the waiting room so they cannot re-enter the Zoom meeting.

If someone is behaving inappropriately and disruptively outside of workshop event hours, please report the incident to workshop organizers Douglas Rao (yrao5@ncsu.edu) and Sheila Saia (ssaia@ncsu.edu).
